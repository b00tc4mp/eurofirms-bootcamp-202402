// The indexOf() method compares searchElement to elements of the array using strict equality (the same algorithm used by the === operator). NaN values are never compared as equal, so indexOf() always returns -1 when searchElement is NaN.

// The indexOf() method skips empty slots in sparse arrays.

// The indexOf() method is generic. It only expects the this value to have a length property and integer-keyed properties.
